# Basic-PHP
Practice with basic PHP to familiarize with while, for-loops strings, and arrays and learn basic file I/O in PHP

TASK 1
Use a while-loop to simulate a dice roll (random number between 1-6). Stop the loop when a 6 is “rolled”.

Task 2
Create an array of 10 strings (words) each starting with an uppercase letter (the rest of the string should be lower case). You can use any words that you want, they do not have to be the words shown below. Print out a table where the first column is the word and the second column is the word in all uppercase letters.

Task 3
In the ZIP file, there is a file named “classList.txt”.The task is to read the contents of this file and print out each line of the file as a paragraph (<p> .. </p>) into the HTML page. If the line contains EECS, print out the line as a <p class=“highlight”> . . </p>, which has been defined in CSS to have a yellow background. If a “1st year” text in the line is found, make the output bold.
